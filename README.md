# Template-Matching
Template matching is advantageous as it is simple, easy to implement, effective in finding specific features within an image, and has the ability to detect objects without requiring extensive training data, making it particularly useful in situations where you need to identify well-defined, known objects in an image with minimal setup.
In the above project we use template matching to identiify 'messi' face in original image
